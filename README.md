This repository is used for MIKE OPERATIONS scripts. 
The Python scripts are organised depending on the type of task to perform.
The scripts should come with a readme.txt file explaining what the script does.
Supporting files (configuration spreadsheet, etc.) should also be provided.
From release 2017.4, the script manager is directly integrated with this GitHub repository.

This is in Branch: TestScriptIntegration
